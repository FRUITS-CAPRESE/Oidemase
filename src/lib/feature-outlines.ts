/**
 * Feature: Real-Time Crowd Congestion Heatmap Display
 *
 * Description from user:
 * A simple app that uses AI to visually display real-time crowd congestion
 * at major tourist destinations in Hakodate, Hokkaido (temples, shrines,
 * theme parks, bustling districts, etc.) using heatmaps and color-coding
 * (green: vacant, yellow: moderately crowded, red: crowded).
 *
 * Potential Implementation Steps:
 * 1. Data Source:
 *    - Utilize existing `predictCongestion` AI flow for congestion levels.
 *    - Consider enhancements for more "real-time" data if needed (e.g., more frequent updates for AI, different data inputs).
 *
 * 2. Visualisation - Heatmap:
 *    - Decide on the method for heatmap display:
 *      a) On a map: Integrate a mapping library (e.g., Leaflet, Mapbox GL JS with React wrappers)
 *         to show spots with color-coded heat indicators. This is a significant addition.
 *      b) Abstract heatmap: A dashboard view showing spots with intensity represented by color/size without a geographical map.
 *      c) Enhance existing cards: Make card backgrounds or other visual elements more dynamic based on congestion.
 *
 * 3. Visualisation - Color-Coding:
 *    - Green: Vacant / Low congestion
 *    - Yellow: Moderately crowded / Moderate congestion
 *    - Red: Crowded / High congestion
 *    - This is partially implemented in `SpotCard` badges and can be expanded.
 *
 * 4. UI Components:
 *    - Potentially a new component for the heatmap display (e.g., `<CongestionMap />` or `<CongestionDashboard />`).
 *    - Modify `HomePage` (`src/app/page.tsx`) to include this new component or adapt existing ones.
 *
 * 5. Real-Time Aspect:
 *    - Implement a mechanism for periodic data refresh on the client-side for the AI predictions.
 *    - Or, if true real-time updates are needed, explore server-sent events or WebSockets (these are more complex).
 *
 * @param {object} _appState - Placeholder for application state or context if needed in future development.
 * @returns {void}

    Next Steps to consider:
    - Clarify which part of this feature to implement first (e.g., enhance cards, new map component).
    - Decide on the specific heatmap visualization approach.
    - Define data requirements and refresh strategy for the heatmap.
